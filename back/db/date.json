My Dad came home with a brand new zx81 when I was 9 years old!  He spent hours trying to plug it in and get it working - took me 5 mins, and I was hooked!  This very moment defined my life and career, and I am now working for a large multinational running global infra with a $2.5bil IT budget!  And all thanks to the humble ZX81!<br><br>I have a bit of a collection and will post a few pics later to see what you think!  I havent got a clue if I have anything rare or interesting, but it will be fun finding out!<br><br>Looking forward to some interesting chats!<br><br>Cheers, Nic.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href=\"https:\/\/sinclairzxworld.com\/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3351\">Iscanic<\/a> \u2014 Thu Jun 29, 2023 10:40 pm<\/p><hr \/>\n]]>"},{"creator":"dr beep","date":1688068296,"link":"https:\/\/sinclairzxworld.com\/viewtopic.php?t=5135&amp;p=51621#p51621","title":"SALES \u2022 Supergames 10 now available at cronosoft]]>","content":"\nFinally released.<br><br><a href=\"https:\/\/cronosoft.fwscart.com\/product\/super-programs-10-sinclair-zx81-1k-ram-cassette\" class=\"postlink\">https:\/\/cronosoft.fwscart.com\/product\/s ... m-cassette<\/a>#<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href=\"https:\/\/sinclairzxworld.com\/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1133\">dr beep<\/a> \u2014 Thu Jun 29, 2023 9:51 pm<\/p><hr \/>\n]]>"}],"0":true}]
